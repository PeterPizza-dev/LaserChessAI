# LaserChessAI
This repo is made to develop an adverserial AI. The implementation comes with a window interface, where you can choose to play against a freind or an AI. The code can be made using mac os (checked with darwin-terminal), and Linux Ubuntu 18.04.
There are two compiled files given for Linux and Mac, but in order to build the game itself, you will need the below.


# Running the application
In order to compile the code, and run the game you would need to install freeglut (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/). This is verison 3+
When you have that, you can call the MAKEFILE in the src folder, by saying "make".

# Linux/Ubuntu
pip install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

# Mac 
brew install freeglut
